# node-crisp-http-cache
Middleware providing a crispy fresh cache for HTTP responses. This cache adheres to best practices for caching HTTP requests similarly to what you would see implemented in a CDN or a proxy server. crisp-http-cache is best used in dynamic environments (since ETags still require processing), a microservice architecture, or where an HTTP Cache like a full on CDN would be overly complex.
